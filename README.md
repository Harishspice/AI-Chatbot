# AI Powered LANGCHAIN Chatbot

This project is designed only using langchain framework proposed by open-ai which has been very rarely used since it's release. The code is made open source so anyone can use it just by changing names of the file name you are going to use

## Installation
There is no need to install anything in order to use the code. All you have to do is to copy the code to any python environment (google colab in this case)
and change the filename

## Requirements
You need an api code in order to use this which can be taken from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
Type any name in the box and you can generate the api code.

## Working of the model
